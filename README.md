##### Implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes and KNN for digit recoginition

We use the MNIST digits dataset to show the results of 2 classifiers KNN and Gaussian Naive Bayes that were coded from scratch using numpy and scipy.

Here are the means of the pixels for each digit:

Here are the standard deviations of the pixels for each digit:

Classification rate is 0.57.
